# Pianopad
Pianopad is a solution to enable the usage of Launchpad controllers as keyboards. Keyboard as in music, not as in typing. Well, _keyboards as in type as well_, but mainly as in music. :P

Right now this is far from its final state and usage is recomended only for developers or curious people, end-user usage is not recommended due to bugs and poor usability.

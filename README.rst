Pianopad is a solution to enable the usage of Launchpad controllers as keyboards. Keyboard as in music, not as in typing. Well, *keyboards as in type as well*, but mainly as in music. :P

Right now this is far from its final state and usage is recomended only for developers or curious people, end-user usage is not recommended due to bugs and poor usability. Feedback is welcome, as it will help improving it in the long term.

A better demo video would also be nice, maybe someone doing some *real* music using it? :)
